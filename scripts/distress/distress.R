## STATEMENT OF "VANDERWEEL-E-VALUE FROM TYLER

# “With an observed risk ratio of RR = XX, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of XX -fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of XX -fold each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.”

# EVALUES FOR CONTINOUS VARS - p.448
# For a continuous outcome, with a standardized effect size “d” (obtained by dividing the mean difference on the outcome variable between exposure groups by the pooled standard deviation of the outcome) and a stan- dard error for this effect size sd , an approximate E-value can be obtained (VanderWeele and Ding, 2017) by ap- plying the approximation RR ≈ exp(0.91 × d) and then using the E-value formula above (E-value = RRobs + √RRobs(RRobs − 1)). An approximate confidence inter- val can be found using the approximation
# 􏰛exp{0.91×d −1.78×sd},exp{0.91×d +1.78×sd}􏰜

# We could include statements like this in all empirical papers


# NOTE THAT I HAVE WRITTEN WRAPPER FUNCTIONS TO AUTOMATE REPORTING OF EVALUES, ALSO TO CREATE TABLES -- YOUR WORK IS LIGHT!
# however the code is:


# round(EValue::evalues.OLS(
#   ,
#   se = ,
#   sd = sd,
#   delta = delta,
#   true = 0
# ), 3)
# round(EValue::evalues.RR(, lo =  , hi = , true = 1), 4)

# STATEMENT OF EVALUE -----------------------------------------------------

# “With an observed risk ratio of RR=0.28, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 6.6-fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 3.1-fold each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.”

# Confounding control variables  ---------------------------------------------------------
# These variables can be modified depending on your model and assumptions.
#  Here, we use vanderweele's "disjunctive cause criterion"

# FROM Outcomewide longitudinal designs: https://doi.org/10.1214/19-STS728
#" A modified disjunctive cause criterion that might thus be more useful in practice could articulated as follows (VanderWeele, 2019): control for each covari- ate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome." p.443
